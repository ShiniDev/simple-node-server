<h3>Summarize Description</h3>
<p>A simple no-dependencies GET HTTP method web server.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
<p>
    Well, to be honest. I've always wanted to create a web server from the ground up
    using a language like C or C++. But you know life happens, and suddenly you should
    learn javascript.
</p>
<p>
    The whole program itself are very-very incomplete T_T as a server. I would one day
    create a full fledge server that can do every HTTP Method you can think of. But for now
    I guess I should proceed to learning Express with MongoDB. Thanks for reading!.
